	Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Timothy Ahong. I studied Aerospace Engineering at the University of Toronto.
	</p>
	<div class="page-header"></div>
	<p>
	Aerospace Engineering has been a challenging and enlightening area of study. The program includes a breadth of fields from fluid dynamics to robotics to space systems design. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Within Aerospace my interests are primarily robotics and control systems. Here are a few <i>robots</i> I have worked on during my Undergraduate degree. Check out the project pages for more details!

	<p>
	During 3rd year I had my first exposure to web development by playing around with Ruby on Rails. After 3rd year I started my PEY (Professional Experience Year) at EventMobi, a Toronto based startup, as a full-stack web developer.
	</p>

	<p>
	My day-to-day work included front-end development with Backbone.js, or more recently Angular.js, back-end development with CodeIgniter, Flask, NodeJS, MongoDB, MySQL and server management using Chef and later Ansible. Towards the end of my PEY I was given an offer to continue working at EventMobi to develop and launch their new registration platform.
	</p>

	<p>
	Aside from EventMobi I have worked on several contracts, hackathons and side-projects to hone my web-fu. Check out the project pages for details!
