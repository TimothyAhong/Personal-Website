	Welcome to my portfolio website! 
	My name is Timothy Ahong.
	I'm currently studying Aerospace Engineering at the University of Toronto and will complete my degree by May 2015.
	I am also interested in web development.

	<p>
	Aerospace Engineering has been a challenging and enlightening area of study. The program includes a breadth of fields from fluid dynamics to robotics to space systems design. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Within Aerospace my interests are primarily robotics and control systems. Here are a few <i>robots</i> I have worked on during my Undergraduate degree. Check out the project pages for more details!

	<p>
	Outside of Aerospace I have been pursuing web development. During 3rd year I learned just enough Ruby on Rails and Javascript to land a 16 month work term at EventMobi as a full-stack developer. 
	</p>

	<p>
	My day-to-day work included front-end development with Backbone.js, or more recently Angular.js, back-end development with CodeIgniter, MySQL, NodeJS, MongoDB and server management using chef.
	</p>

	<p>
	Aside from EventMobi I have worked on several contracts, hackathons and side-projects to hone my web-fu. Check out the project pages for details!
