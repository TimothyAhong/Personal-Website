				<h3 class="section-header">Overview</h3>
				<p>
				Tile Titans is an HTML5 game that I developed as a side project over the summer of 2013. It is a turn based board game that plays like a mix between chess and tic-tac-toe.

				<h3 class="section-header">Key Learnings</h3>
				<p>
				When developing Tile Titans I spent too much time developing non-gameplay features such as a store for purchasing additional tiles and a way to add and challenge friends. I should have only focussed on developing the the core game and a simple matchmaking system and then developed the other features after launching it on Kongregate.

				<h3 class="section-header">Version 1</h3>
				<p>Developed in association with the <a href="http://tetra.sa.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto TETRA society</a> and several of its members.
				The Concert For The Deaf is an initiative to enable the deaf and hard of hearing to experience music. 
				</p>
				<p>
				We developed a small box that converts audio signals to tactile vibrations. The version 1 prototype was constructed during the <a href="http://hackday.linkedin.com/toronto/2013">LinkedIn Toronto Hackday 2013</a> and received 3rd place.
