	<p>Developed in association with the <a href="http://tetra.sa.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto TETRA society</a> and several of its members.
	The Concert For The Deaf is an initiative to enable the deaf and hard of hearing to experience music. 
	</p>
	<p>
	We developed a small box that converts audio signals to tactile vibrations. The version 1 prototype was constructed during the <a href="http://hackday.linkedin.com/toronto/2013">LinkedIn Toronto Hackday 2013</a> and recieved 3rd place.
