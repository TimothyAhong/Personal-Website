	<p>Designed and developed as part of the Unviversity of Toronto Engineering Science Undergraduate AER201 Design course.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Students were placed in groups of 3 and given a design problem for which they must construct an automous robot. My role on the team was electro-mechanical design and construction. Here is a video of an early version test run:

	<p>
	The purpose of the robot is to stack rolls of tape onto poles. The robot scans the pole for tape then dispenses 1 or 2 rolls of tape via the swinging arm.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The robot is controlled by a PIC18 and programmed entirely in assembly (part of the course is learning assembly).
