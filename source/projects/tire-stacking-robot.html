				<p>
				This is an autonomous tape stacking robot that was designed and developed as part of the University of Toronto Engineering Science Undergraduate AER201 Design course. I was part of a team of 3 who developed the robot.

				<b>Buy premade circuitry:</b> Our team spent a large amount of time debugging and tweaking our homemade circuits that dealt with sensors input (IR ranger and shaft encoder) and controlling our actuators (DC motors, solenoids and servos). Many of these circuits can be purchased as pre-made PCBs and we found out later that they are often cheaper than buying the components yourself! Although it was a good learning experience to manually build these circuits I will default to buying the pre-made PCBs in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Minimize the number of moving parts:</b> Our design involved 1 DC motor for locomotion, 2 DC motors for the lift, 1 servo for the arm and a solenoid on the arm. Each moving part added considerable time and complexity to the project. In hindsight I would have traded the additonal functionality offered by more actuators for improved

				<h3 class="section-header">AER201 Course</h3>
				<p>
				The AER201 course is a 2nd year design course that is one of the hallmarks of U of T's Engineering Science program. Students are placed in groups of 3 and given a design problem for which they must construct an autonomous robot.
				<br /><br/>
				The purpose of the robot is to stack rolls of tape onto poles such that after the run each pole has exactly 2 rolls of tape. Each pole can start the run with either 0, 1 or 2 rolls of tape so the autonomous robot must detect the number of rolls on each pole and dispense rolls accordingly.

				<h3 class="section-header">Our Solution</h3>
				<p>
				Our solution was a mobile platform with a swining arm that dropped rolls onto each pole. Our robot would drive until it detected a pole using IR sensors and then it would count the number of rolls on the pole with additional IR sensors.
				<br/><br/>
				After determining the number of rolls to dispense a pully would raise 1 or 2 rolls up into the arm using DC motors and a bike chain lift. Once the rolls were raised the arm would grasp onto them using solenoids and rotate out to the correct angle using the servo controlled arm.
				<br/><br/>
				The robot was controlled by a PIC18 microcontroller and one of the requirements was that all programming be done in assembly language.
				</p>
				<h3 class="section-header">My Role</h3>
				<p>
				Each team member selected an area of responsibility, the possibilities were electromechanical, circuits and programming. My responsibility on the team was electromechanical. This role consisted of machining the parts, building the robot and selecting/testing the actuators.
