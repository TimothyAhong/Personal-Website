	<p>Designed and developed for the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) to perform multi-vehicle simulations on various terrains.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Capable of legged maneuvers as well as wheeled locomotion. Each robot comes equipped with a series of sensors including a 320p camera, 4 IR rangers, 1 Sonar, 4 microswitches, shaft encoders and servo readouts.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The onboard circuits are proprietary PCBs, designed and developed in-house. The robot is controlled by a PIC32 microcontroller.

	Each PIC32 is preloaded with custom firmware that provides actuator control methods, odometry methods and wireless communication with the included PC application. The PC application connects wirelessly to the robots via RF. The PC application can query sensors, control actuators and bootload programs to the onboard PIC32s.
