			<h3 class="section-header">Overview</h3>
			<p>
			Tile Titans is an HTML5 game that I developed as a side project over the summer of 2013. It is a turn based board game that plays like a mix between chess and tic-tac-toe.

			<h3 class="section-header">Skills</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>AngularJS</li>
				<li>CoffeeScript</li>
				<li>LESS</li>
				<li>NodeJS</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="section-header">Key Learnings</h3>
			<p>
			When developing Tile Titans I spent too much time developing non-gameplay features such as a store for purchasing additional tiles and a way to add and challenge friends. I should have only focussed on developing the the core game and a simple matchmaking system and then developed the other features after launching it on Kongregate.

			<p>
			I developed a V1 of the game as part of the UKEN games hackathon

			The game runs on HTML5 inside the browser. Client side code leverages AngularJS, CoffeeScript and Less and is delivered to the client via Amazon's CloudFront CDN. 
			<br />
			The servers run NodeJS with Socket.io as the communication layer and are hosted on Amazon EC2. The nodes hit a MongoDB hosted by MongoHQ for persistent storage and a Redis server (also EC2) for everything else.
